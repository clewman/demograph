# Demograph
## Public Access Analytics- Analytics for the People
A PDX Code Guild Capstone Project


Project Overview
This web application allows users to pull information from a database and create custom graphs. These graphs can be used for a variety of uses, including: student reports in science, social science, and English; socially motivated groups who need graphs in their reports, social media, advertising, and more; the farming industry who need data on exports, commodities, farm scale, consumption, sales, and labor; as well as for any person interested in seeing the relationship between poverty, education, employment, population size, food access, and farm characteristics. 

This project will be wrapped in Django and include Python for parsing through the government data set, JavaScript to enhance the user experience, 

Functionality
Walk through the application from the user's perspective. What will they see on each page? What can they input and click and see? How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

Data Model
What data will you need to store as part of your application? These should be specific nouns, collections of information that serve a collective purpose. Examples might be 'User', 'Book', 'ImageSet'.

Schedule
Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
